Understanding the concepts of `undefined` and `not defined` is critical when debugging JavaScript programs. Both terms describe different states of variables, and here’s how they differ:
#### **1. Undefined**

- **Definition**: A variable is `undefined` when it is declared but not initialized with a value.
- **Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated to the variable, but no value is assigned. JavaScript uses `undefined` as a placeholder.
- **Characteristics**:
    - `undefined` is a specific data type.
    - It occupies memory in the execution context.
    - Can be used explicitly:
```
	 let a; // Declared but not initialized
	 console.log(a); // Output: undefined
```

- **Key Point**: `undefined` is not the same as empty or null; it represents a placeholder for variables that are yet to be assigned a value.
---

- #### **2. Not Defined**

- **Definition**: A variable is "not defined" when it has not been declared at all in the program.
- **Memory Allocation**: No memory is allocated for a "not defined" variable.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Accessing such variables results in a `ReferenceError`.
    - Example
    ```
	console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
	```

#### **Why JavaScript is Loosely Typed or Weakly Typed?**

- JavaScript’s handling of `undefined` and `not defined` showcases its flexibility and type system.
- It allows developers to declare variables without assigning values initially, which adds to its dynamic nature.
```
let a; // Undefined
a = 10; // Now defined with a value
```
### **Probable Interview Questions**

 **1.  What is the difference between `undefined` and `not defined`?**
    
- **Answer**: `undefined` means a variable is declared but not assigned a value, while `not defined` means the variable has not been declared in the program.

 **2. Does `undefined` occupy memory in JavaScript?**
    
- **Answer**: Yes, `undefined` takes memory as a placeholder for declared but uninitialized variables.

**3. Why is JavaScript considered loosely typed?**
    
-  **Answer**: JavaScript allows variables to hold values of any data type and uses placeholders like `undefined`, making it flexible and dynamic.

 **4. What happens when you try to access a variable that is not defined?**
-  **Answer**: It throws a `ReferenceError`.
 ```
 // Undefined
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

// Not Defined
console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined
```
